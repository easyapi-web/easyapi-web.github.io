# Configuration Overview

This guide explains how to configure the plugin to match your needs. The plugin is designed with a **configuration optional** approach, allowing immediate use while providing extensive customization options when needed.

### Zero configuration, out of the box

- Once the plugin is installed, it can be used without any additional configuration. In general, if any information needs to be provided during the API export, the plugin will prompt a window for you to fill in as required.

### Additional configuration options

- [Setting in IDEA](ide-setting.md)
    - Quick configuration through the IDE interface for adjusting common plugin behaviors and preferences.

- [Configuration file in project](local-file-config.md)
    - Advanced configuration through project-level files for teams requiring specific code style rules and custom behaviors.
