# Configuration of postman

- If the `token` of `postman` is required during export, an input will be provided in a pop-up window.

- Alternatively, it can be manually configured in [Postman](ide-setting.md#postman) under <kbd>Preferences(Settings)</kbd> > <kbd>Other Settings</kbd> > <kbd>EasyApi</kbd>.

- The `token` of `postman` refers to Postman API keys, which are used to authorize your requests to the Postman API. It can be generated from the [Postman Integrations Dashboard](https://go.postman.co/integrations/services/pm_pro_api).
